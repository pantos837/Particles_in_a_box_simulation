# Particles_in_a_box_simulation
This script simulates the movement of particles  in a box split in half assuming all particles was initially in the left side and compares it to the theoriticall equation that describes the pehenomena.
The script named number_of_nanoparticles gives the theoritical movement of particles.
The script number Particles_on_a_box simulation is the script that simulates the movement and compares it to the theoritical prediction.
The user is able to determine the number of nanoparticles and the time of the simulation.
